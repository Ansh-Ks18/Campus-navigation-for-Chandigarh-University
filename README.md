# Introduction

The campus navigation system for Chandigarh University uses advanced computer vision techniques to offer real-time navigation assistance. It helps students, faculty, and visitors efficiently navigate the campus by identifying pathways, buildings, and landmarks with high precision, even under challenging conditions.

## Features

-Sophisticated Edge Detection: Utilizes advanced algorithms to identify pathways, buildings, and landmarks with high precision, even in challenging lighting conditions.

-Visual Data Analysis**: Maps key features of the campus to guide users efficiently.

-Robustness and Adaptability: Functions reliably in various lighting scenarios and adapts to changes such as construction or seasonal variations.

-Safety and Security Enhancements: Reduces the risk of getting lost or entering restricted areas and offers potential integration with campus security systems.

-Data Insights: Collects data on user movements and interactions, providing valuable insights for resource utilization and campus planning.

## Installation

To set up the campus navigation system, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository:
  bash
  git clone https://github.com/Ansh-Ks18/Campus-navigation-for-Chandigarh-University.git

  
2.Navigate to the project directory:
  bash
